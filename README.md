a web app in progress as part of a project for General Assembly. 

The idea for this web app is to create a platform for job seekers (of which i am one) to connect with 
employers. I wanted to do something with a backend focus, that required multiple backend models and relationships and that i could see myself using. 

### Installation
If you would like to spin up a copy on your end (and help me figure out how to finish this) the following details below should get you there. 

This may also be useful to future me wanting to fix any bugs or outstanding features...

1) run flask on the backend ```pipenv shell```
2) install dependencies ```npm i```
3) fire up flask on the back end ```flask --debug run```
3) in a seperate terminal window start react to launch the front-end ```npm start```
